ACADEMIC PROJECTS
Title: Project Turtle
Team size: 2
Summary: Developed a shell script for streamlined installation of essential tools on Linux systems. Implemented
error handling and rigorous compatibility testing across multiple distributions. This project was part of hacktoberfest
and more people contributed to the code. It was used to bootstrap a lot of tools on Linux servers and workstations.
Title: Yet Another Markdown Converter
Team size: 1
Description: Designed a Command Line Interface(CLI) tool to convert Markdown files to plain HTML. This
versatile tool not only facilitates the conversion of Markdown-formatted documents into HTML but also offers
additional theming and styling options. Users can customize the appearance of the HTML output generated
according to their preferences, enhancing the visual presentation of the content. The CLI nature of the tool ensures
ease of use in a terminal environment, providing users with a flexible and automated solution for Markdown to
HTML conversion.
Title: DoctorPres
Team size: 1
Description: Developed a Doctor Prescription System to replace handwritten prescriptions with a digital solution.
The dataset for medicines and diseases utilized in this research was sourced from an official Indian Government
website. It utilizes Streamlit for a user-friendly interface and a MySQL database for robust data storage. The system
allows doctors to electronically issue and manage patient prescriptions and bills. Key database tables include
information on doctors, patients, medicines, and billing. It incorporates advanced database features like triggers for
data validation and procedures for complex queries. The project aims to create a fast, responsive, and scalable digital
prescription platform.
Title: Capstone Project (Final Year Project)
Team size: 4
Summary: Created a secure platform for Dapps by integrating a blockchain, establishing a decentralized, tamper
resistant system enhancing network security. An ONOS controller cluster was created to eradicate the single point of
failure. Rigorous evaluation will gauge performance, security, scalability, highlighting blockchain’s potential in
addressing security challenges.
SDN offers flexibility and programmability but lacks in providing robust application security
